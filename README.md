# Problem: Lack of Accessibility to Dungeons & Dragons

# Description: A Web-Based Game Inspired by Dungeons & Dragons

Our project will be a web-based application centered around a text-based dungeons & dragons style adventure. The user can create a character and allocate their skill points to a pool of skills, and embark on an adventure to find treasure, encounter monsters, and explore.

# Technologies: React, SpringBoot (Java), FastAPI (Python)
