# Problem: Lack of Accessibility to Dungeons & Dragons

# Description: A Web-Based Game Inspired by Dungeons & Dragons

Our project will be a web-based application centered around a text-based dungeons & dragons style adventure. The user can create a character and allocate their skill points to a pool of skills, and embark on an adventure to find treasure, encounter monsters, and explore.

# Technologies: React, SpringBoot (Java), FastAPI (Python)

The project is split into three main directories:

1. /frontend - Directory for the React frontend
2. /backend - Directory for the SpringBoot backend
3. /diffusion - Directory for the FastAPI StableDiffusion Application

To run the frontend application locally with Vite / npm:<br /> 1. "npm i" <br /> 2. "npm run dev"<br />

To run the FastAPI StableDiffusion Model locally with an Nvidia GPU (CUDA):
"diffuzers api"
